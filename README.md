# Project 3: Intelligent Analysis of Digikala Reviews

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an intelligent system that analyzes Persian Digikala product reviews :
1. Predict whether the user **recommends** the product (`recommendation_status`).
2. Predict an ordered **rating band** (`rating_band`) derived from the numeric `rate`.

The project includes:
- Descriptive data analysis
- Persian text normalization
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression baselines
- Fine-tuned Persian BERT (`HooshvareLab/bert-fa-base-uncased`)
- A semi-supervised experiment with pseudo-labeling (confidence threshold = 0.90)
- Error analysis and offline inference

### Distribution of `rate`: Skewness, Concentration, and Most Frequent Values

| rate | count (n) | percentage (pct) | cumulative pct |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.0 | 2,398,801 | 38.97% | 38.97% |
| 4.0 | 1,515,723 | 24.62% | 63.59% |
| 3.0 | 958,799 | 15.57% | 79.16% |
| 0.0 | 529,098 | 8.59% | 87.75% |
| 1.0 | 327,662 | 5.32% | 93.08% |
| 4.8 | 7,276 | 0.12% | 98.02% |
| 3.4 | 7,250 | 0.12% | 98.13% |
| 3.6 | 6,975 | 0.11% | 98.25% |
| 2.5 | 5,438 | 0.09% | 98.34% |

**What I observed:** The `rate` column contains **178 unique values** ranging from 0 to 2500 (one record with value 2500 is outside the valid 0–5 range and is invalid). The distribution is heavily right-skewed: the value 5.0 with **38.97%**, 4.0 with **24.62%**, and 3.0 with **15.57%** are the most frequent values. The five most frequent values (5, 4, 3, 0, 1) together cover **93.08%** of the data, and the top 20 values cover **98.34%** — indicating a highly concentrated distribution. Notably, `rate = 0.0` accounts for **8.59%** (about 529k records), showing that a substantial portion of users gave a zero rating (not missing data). Additionally, `rate = 2.0` does not appear among the top 20 values — a pattern consistent with the "polarization of opinions" phenomenon (users are either highly satisfied or highly dissatisfied).

**What it means:** The `rate` distribution is skewed and concentrated, exhibiting a J-shaped pattern (a peak at 5, a steep decline, and a small bump at 0 and 1). With the project thresholds, the derived `rating_band` is expected to be relatively imbalanced (with the `high` band dominant).

**What I will do:** For `rating_band`, I will use class weighting and ordinal distance error. I will remove the record with `rate = 2500` as invalid data.

## Part A — Descriptive Analysis:

### A1. Dataset Size and Structure

- **Total records:** 6,156,289 (counted via DuckDB parser, not physical lines)
- **Columns:** 15 (all required columns present, no extra columns)
- **Unique products:** 331,599
- **Unique sellers:** 29,214
- **File size:** 1.28 GB (CSV) → compressed to Parquet with ZSTD

**Review distribution per product:**
- Median: 4 reviews
- Mean: 18.57 (std = 40.93 → right-skewed)
- 90th percentile: 46
- 99th percentile: 200
- Max: 400

**Product concentration:**
- Top 10 products account for only **0.05%** of all reviews
- No product has more than 1,000 reviews

**Decision:** A product-grouped split is required to prevent the model from memorizing product-specific patterns. See A5 for the updated justification.
